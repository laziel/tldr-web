TL;DR Web Frontend
------------------
This is a web frontend for [TL;DR](https://github.com/suminb/tldr) (text
summarization service).

TODO
----
* The Javascript code tries to manually manipulate DOM objects via jQuery. This
  kind of works but is not a good solution. This must be replaced with a
  model-based architecture (e.g., Backbone.js) at some point.
